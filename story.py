                a {14} contest. I was feeling {15}, so I accepted. We

                punches at each other. In the end, I emerged victorious,
                much to the {17} disappointment of my opponent.
                Exhausted but {18}, I returned home and went straight
                to bed.\n
                As I drifted off to {19}, I couldn't help but think
                that it had been a truly remarkable day. So if you're

                and set off into the {10} unknown. Who knows

                along the way!"""
