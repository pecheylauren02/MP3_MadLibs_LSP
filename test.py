# Story Template Two of Eight

story_two = f"""Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a {adjective_one} {noun_one} who 
loved to {verb_one}. One day, while {verb_two + 'ing'} in the {place_one}, the {adjective_one} {noun_one} 
stumbled upon a {adjective_two} {noun_two} who was {verb_three + 'ing'} with a {adjective_three} {noun_three}.
"Hey there, {exclamation}!" exclaimed the {adjective_one} {noun_one}. "Would you like to join us in our 
{adjective_four} {verb_one + 'ing'}?"

Without hesitation, the {adjective_two} {noun_two} agreed and soon found themselves {verb_one + 'ing'} 
with the {adjective_two} {noun_two} and their {adjective_three} {noun_three}. They {verb_four} and {verb_four}, 
and even did a little {verb_five} together.

But then, out of nowhere, a {adjective_four} {noun_four} appeared and started throwing things {adverb_one} at them! 
The {adjective_one} {noun_one} and the {adjective_two} {noun_two} were afraid, but to their surprise, the 
{adjective_three} {noun_three} stood tall and {verb_six} the {adjective_four} {noun_four}.
From {random_date}, the {adjective_one} {noun_one} made a promise to themselves to always be open to new experiences 
and never to be afraid of a little {verb_one}. And who knows? Maybe they'll even meet another {any_number} 
{adjective_four} {noun_four} along the way.
The end."""
